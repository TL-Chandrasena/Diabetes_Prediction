# Diabetes Health Indicators - Machine Learning Project

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset from Kaggle, leveraging machine learning models to predict diabetes based on behavioral, demographic, and health-related factors. The dataset, derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, contains 253,680 records with 21 key features. Our goal is to develop and compare various classification models to improve diabetes prediction accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
